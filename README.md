# Super-Linter Job

We have set up a GitHub Actions workflow called Super-Linter that automatically checks the codebase for linting issues whenever a push is made to the repository's main branch.


## How it Works

- Linting: The Super-Linter job runs on Ubuntu-latest runner and utilizes GitHub's Super-Linter action to lint the entire codebase for various languages.
- Trigger: The workflow triggers on push events to the main branch.
- Environment: The job environment is Ubuntu-latest.
- Secrets: It utilizes the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication with GitHub API.

### Contributing to the Workflow

1. Fork the Repository: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Make Changes: Make any necessary changes or improvements to the GitHub Actions workflow file (`main.yml`) or the codebase.
3. Submit Pull Requests: Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request to the main repository's main branch. Be sure to include a clear description of the changes you've made.
4. Review Process: Your pull request will undergo review by project maintainers. Make any requested changes, if necessary.
5. Merge: Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch and become part of the repository's workflow.
